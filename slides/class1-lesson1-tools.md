### Goal: Understanding arrays

1. Create an array with a list of items in it, using the [Codepen](http://codepen.io/pen/) website. For example, you could make a "favoriteFoods" array made up of strings, or an "importantDates" list made up of numbers.
2. Use a for loop and console.log() to print out each item inside your array.

### Goal: Understanding objects

1. Create an object with multiple properties, using the [Codepen](http://codepen.io/pen/) website. For example, you could make a "student" object with the properties "name" and "hometown".
2. Use console.log() to print out a sentence that includes the properties of that object. For example, "[name] is from [hometown]."


### Goal: Understanding functions
