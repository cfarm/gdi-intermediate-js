1. Create an object with multiple properties. For example, you could make a "student" object with the properties "name" and "hometown".
2. Use console.log() to print out a sentence that includes the properties of that object. For example, "[name] is from [hometown]."

## Goal: Understanding functions

1. Create a function that takes at least one argument. For example, you could make an "announce" function that alerts "Important announcement:" followed by the argument.
2. Call your function with an argument of your choice. For example, you could announce "Dogs are cute".

## Goal: Understanding events and 'this'

1. In HTML, create a link to the website of your choice. 
2. Using a JavaScript "onclick" event, make clicking on the link alert the linkâ€™s "href". 

Hint: never used the "onclick" event before, and not sure how to use it? Check out w3schools.com for <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/event_onclick.asp">some documentation and examples</a>
